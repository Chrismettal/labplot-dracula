### [Labplot](https://labplot.kde.org/)

#### Usage

This theme consists of 3 parts:

- General application theme
- Worksheet theme (The actual plot area)
- Colormap (Used only for spreadsheet highlighting at the moment)

The worksheet theme has been merged into the LabPlot source and is included in every installation starting with `LABPLOT VERSION PENDING`.

The application theme is currently being created to be included in LabPlot's source as well.

The colormap is pending review and likely won't be included in LabPlots source, so this part needs to be installed manually if required.

#### Installing manually

##### Download using Git

If you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo:
